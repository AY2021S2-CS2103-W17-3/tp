## Project: BookCoin

BookCoin is a CLI facility management system which allows users to type in commands to manage bookings and presents users a structured and detailed information on facility availability.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to delete previously added venues.
    * What it does: allows the user to delete any previous added venues one at a time. 
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a venue could become permanently unavailable for booking, and the app should provide a convenient way to delete them.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to find venues and persons by any of their attributes.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to edit any attributes belonging to any venues or persons.
