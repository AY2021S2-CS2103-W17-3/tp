## Project: BookCoin

BookCoin is a CLI facility management system which allows users to type in commands to manage bookings and presents users a structured and detailed information on facility availability.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to delete previously added venues.
    * What it does: allows the user to delete any previous added venues one at a time. 
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a venue could become permanently unavailable for booking, and the app should provide a convenient way to delete them.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to edit any attributes belonging to any venues or persons.
  * What it does: allows the user to edit all previously added venues one at a time.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in the addition of venue details and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
