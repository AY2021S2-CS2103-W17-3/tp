**BookCoin To The Moon is a CLI facility management system which allows users to type in commands to manage bookings and presents users a structured and detailed information on facility availability.
** While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using BookCoin, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing BookCoin, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
