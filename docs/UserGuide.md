BookCoinToTheMoon is a **desktop app for managing bookings and presents users a structured and detailed information on facility availability via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, BookCoinToTheMoon can get your facility management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `find_venue v/VENUE_ID`, `VENUE_ID` is a parameter which can be used as `find_venue v/1`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `create_venue n/VENUE_NAME [max/MAXIMUM_OCCUPANCY]` can be used as `n/Chua Thian Poh Hall max/40` or as `n/Chua Thian Poh Hall`.
* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `bye`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `bye 123`, it will be interpreted as `bye`.
