* **BookCoin To The Moon** is a CLI facility management system which allows users to type in commands to manage bookings and presents users a structured and detailed information on facility availability.
  <br>
* Our targeted users are administrative personnels of schools or organisations who need to manage bookings and usage of a large number of facilities. They have to ensure that bookings and usages of facilities abide by restrictions in addition to checking that the bookings are valid.*
